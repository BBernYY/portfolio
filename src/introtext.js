Hello! I'm Sytze Reitsma (online I use BBernYY) and I'm currently 13 years old.
I'm from The Netherlands, and I've taught myself English through the internet.
I've loved programming since I was eight years old when I discovered Scratch.
In school, I'm in year three (out of six), and I skipped a year when I was six.
I've always enjoyed Physics and Mathematics, which is why I like programming, too.
In my free time I play video games, I built my own PC, and call with my friends.
My skills mainly lay in Python, since that's what i've worked with the most,
But I made this website with React.js, and I've made some games.
Most of my projects are published on GitHub, feel free to have a look!
